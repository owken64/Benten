### HelloScala example (aka DummyApp)

This example is based on the [Hello Gluon](https://github.com/gluonhq/gluon-samples/tree/master/HelloGluon) from Gluon Mobile samples. I called the first version "Dummy App" and only later realized that it would be better if I use the same project for more complicated examples. I recommend you first try to run this one because if it fails you can be pretty sure that the problem lies in your setup of GraalVM, dependencies, Maven, etc., and not in the details of the app you try to run.

The source code is just [one file](https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/blob/main/src/main/scala/helloscala/Main.scala). Here's a [screenshot](https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/blob/main/helloscala/helloscala.png) of what the app looks like when you open it. And [from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SV5waXjyEYSSlo-mfj28WF34mcMFxoG7/view?usp=sharing) you can download the already compiled APK.

Please refer to [How to compile and run an example](https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/wiki/How-to-compile-and-run-an-example) for details on how to, well, compile and run this example.
